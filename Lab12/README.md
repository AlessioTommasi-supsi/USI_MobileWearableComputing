## **Components of Android Application**

### **Activity**  
An **Activity** represents a single screen with a user interface.  
**Example from Lab01**:  

- **Fig1 Location**: `/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
- **Fig2 Location**: `/java/com/MainActivity.java`

In the code, the Activity is linked in Java at line 27 during the `onCreate` method to ensure correct setup and usage.

### **Service**  
A **Service** handles background operations without a user interface.  
We did not use Services in Lab01, but in a Twitter-like app, they could be used for synchronizing notifications or downloading new tweets.

### **Broadcast Receiver**  
A **Broadcast Receiver** allows the app to respond to system events or events from other apps.  
We didnâ€™t use this in Lab01 either, but an example could be limiting resource usage when the battery is low or resetting the counter when the app is put in the background.

**Content Provider**: Allows the sharing of data between different applications. Content providers provide a standard interface for accessing data, such as contacts or media, that can also be used by other apps.
