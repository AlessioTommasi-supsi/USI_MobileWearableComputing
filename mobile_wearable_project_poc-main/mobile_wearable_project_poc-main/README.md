# Mobile and Wearable Computing Project Proof of Concept

This repository contains a proof of concept for the osmdroid library. The application displays the user's current locotation on the map along with a marker for the Lugano city centre. The marker is surrounded by a circle. On click on the Lugano city center marker a custom InfoWindow is opened. Furthermore, a listener is registered that logs the user's location on change.
